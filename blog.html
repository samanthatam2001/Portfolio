    <p>We talked a lot of about robots and their ethics today. How did your idea of robotics change? <i>My idea of robotics changed 
    by how a robot looks. It doesn't have to look like a human or a manchine.</i></p>
    <p>What makes you excited about the future of robotics? Nervous?<i>The idea that humans can make machines alive and do human tasks 
    makes me excited about the future of robotics. However, what makes me nervous is the robots might take over the world and dominate 
    humans.</i></p>
    <p>You worked on circuits in groups, and will be working in groups for the rest of the week. What worked well?<i>I think what worked
    well was the jokes and laughter in my group. They were funny and nice. </i></p>
